* We will define a path as a collection of points on a plane. 
* We will represent a path by the Path class that will save the collection of points.

* We will define a new class called pathit  in order to allow the path class to be Iterable,
meaning that it will be possible to scan The same with the for loop. 
* In each iteration in the loop the next point in the path will be returned.

* The main function will serve as the primary function for the program. This function will be activated only if
* The program is run as a standalone program and is not imported as a package to another program
